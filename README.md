# 2048-reinforcement-learning

 This repository will provide implementation and experiments of some state-of-art reinforcement learning algorithms to train an agent to play 2048. Ideally, this repository will provide an interface for expansion where new algorithms and new games can be easily added. 



## Structure

`games` contains the code for playing the game

`envs` contains the environment of each game, where an agent can get observation, reward, and take actions through API in this folder

`models` contains a bundle of networks



## Train

 To be updated.
